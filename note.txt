Tasks :

How to scale instance beased on requirement?
Scaling compute instance in GCP
 -> instance group
 -> Testing Autoscaling with CPU load (stress command)

How do we manage incoming traffic?

 -> network service 
 -> load balancing

Deployed simple application with autoscaling and load balancing in GCP.

Database connection in GCP

Databases we have: 
 -> cloud sql
         ->MySQL
         ->PostgresSQL
         ->SQL server
  -> cloud spanner
  -> Alloy DB for PostgreSQL
  -> Cloud Bigtable

Google Storage:
-> cloud storage.
        -> GCP storage.(Bucker)
        -> Storage classes:
                ->standard storage
                ->Nearline storage
                ->coldline storage

Azure adminstration Admin
    -> Azure Active directory
    -> Azure Active drectory domain service
    -> Directory joins 
  -> Role Based Access control
         ->Role Assignment
                -> The Principle of Least Privilege
Role Based Access Control
          -> build in roles and custom roles
          -> 2 types of roles RBAC role and Active directory role.

resource locks
       -> Avoid accidental changes
       -> inheritance
       -> Read-only locks
       -> delete locks
in Azure locks can be applied 
->at subscription level
-> resource level
-> resource group level
this locks are 2 types 
 -> delete lock (not allow delete to resource under them or resource if applied on single resource bt we can modify them)
 -> Read only (This lock only allow read only we can't modify resource on whom this are applied)

Analyzing cost in Azure:
->Azure reserved instance
->Azure Hybrid benedit (AHUB)
->Credits And Regions

Azure Policy:
->Definition(JSON documentation)
->Scope
->Assigment
->Compliance
->Usecase:
   ->Allowed Resource types
   ->Allowed Virtual machine SKUs
   -> Allowed location
   -> Require Tags
   -> Inherit Tags
   -> Allowed resource group location
 
Azure Initiative
 -> Channing these policy in sequence order to make and then assigning them as an single unit, This process is known as Azure Initiative.
