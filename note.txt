Tasks :

How to scale instance beased on requirement?
Scaling compute instance in GCP
 -> instance group
 -> Testing Autoscaling with CPU load (stress command)

How do we manage incoming traffic?

 -> network service 
 -> load balancing

Deployed simple application with autoscaling and load balancing in GCP.

Database connection in GCP

Databases we have: 
 -> cloud sql
         ->MySQL
         ->PostgresSQL
         ->SQL server
  -> cloud spanner
  -> Alloy DB for PostgreSQL
  -> Cloud Bigtable

Google Storage:
-> cloud storage.
        -> GCP storage.(Bucker)
        -> Storage classes:
                ->standard storage
                ->Nearline storage
                ->coldline storage
                ->Archive storage
Building API in GCP:
-> Apigee in GCP
         -> Apigee edgeff
Microservice architecher
 -> pub/sub 
 -> subscription
container orchestration in GCP
 -> GCP (GKE)

Azure adminstration Admin
    -> Azure Active directory
    -> Azure Active drectory domain service
    -> Directory joins 
  -> Role Based Access control
         ->Role Assignment
                -> The Principle of Least Privilege
Role Based Access Control
          -> build in roles and custom roles
          -> 2 types of roles RBAC role and Active directory role.

resource locks
       -> Avoid accidental changes
       -> inheritance
       -> Read-only locks
       -> delete locks
in Azure locks can be applied 
->at subscription level
-> resource level
-> resource group level
this locks are 2 types 
 -> delete lock (not allow delete to resource under them or resource if applied on single resource bt we can modify them)
 -> Read only (This lock only allow read only we can't modify resource on whom this are applied)

Analyzing cost in Azure:
->Azure reserved instance
->Azure Hybrid benedit (AHUB)
->Credits And Regions

Azure Policy:
->Definition(JSON documentation)
->Scope
->Assigment
->Compliance
->Usecase:
   ->Allowed Resource types
   ->Allowed Virtual machine SKUs
   -> Allowed location
   -> Require Tags
   -> Inherit Tags
   -> Allowed resource group location
 
Azure Initiative
 -> Channing these policy in sequence order to make and then assigning them as an single unit, This process is known as Azure Initiative.
["This is Mind Blowing"]

Virtual Networks
-?> Represenatation of cloud network
-?> Dedicated instance
-?> Hybrid scenarios
-?> Connectivity between Azure services

Private IP addresses
private ip addresses are used in connection within virtual network 
while public ip address is used in connection with internet outside

DNS Zones
-?> used in DNS resolution on xxx.microsoft.org DNS resolution

 Private DNS Zones 
 -?> this service is used for name resolution only. 
 -?> this service don't deal with establishing connection between them.

Network Security Groups
 -/> Filter traffic 
 -/> Rule set
 -/> Association
 -/> Evaluation
NSG at subnet level subnet will filter network 
NSG at VM.
inbound traffic: source -> Subnet NSG -> Network interface NSG
Outbound traffic: VM -> Network interface NSG -> Subnet NSG

Azure Firewall
- Highly available and scalable 
- Redundancy
- Multiple types of rules
- Threat Intelligence
- Public IP support

Private Links
Private Links are used in setting up connection between on primises service.
example : when using paas service on Azure(Azure SQL) and our application is running on premises setup 
Now, we want connection to be established between them. In this case we use Private Link.

Note: When ever we create an VM we also create 2 other resources. 
They are: 
       1. VM
       2. Public IP
       3. virtual Network ( If already on created )

Virtual Machine : 
planning : 1. Networking
           2. Naming convention
           3. Location ( EAST US lowest price)
           4. Pricing ( pay as you go, Reserved instance)

#~ Availablility set :
#~ having more than one instance at any time. so this instance can exists in multiple FD's 
#~ , this would result in high avaliability of 


(Virtual machine scale set)Deploying Vm scale sets
- Vertical Scaling
- Horizontal Scaling

VM scale sets is like auto scaling in AWS.
